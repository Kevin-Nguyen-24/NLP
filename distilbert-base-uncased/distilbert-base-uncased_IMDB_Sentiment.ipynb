DistilBERT is a compressed version of BERT that retains over 95% of BERT’s accuracy, while being significantly more efficient — 40% smaller and 60% faster in inference.\n","\n","Unlike BERT, which is computationally heavier and slower to train, DistilBERT provides a practical trade-off between performance and efficiency. This makes it especially useful for real-world applications where speed and resource constraints matter.\n","\n","We tokenize input reviews using the DistilBERT tokenizer with truncation and padding, and then fine-tune the model using standard classification techniques. The model is evaluated using accuracy and F1-score to measure its performance in predicting the sentiment of unseen reviews."],"metadata":{"id":"GaghOHxLDSsi"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# ===============================\n","# 1.
